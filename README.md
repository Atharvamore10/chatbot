# esports-chatbot

1. Chatbot.ipynb file is the chatbot which is used to generate responses to the input provided by the user depending on his interest in various sports related activities. The file is created in Jupyter Notebook which is used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
2. We make use of NLTK (natural language toolkit) for creating a chatbot. NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries.
3. The chatbot file has downloaded packages such as punkt, popular, etc. which helps in our purpose. It has two types of responses: robo_response and user_response where robo_response is predefined such as greetings and user_response being answers to query of input strings.
4. A trainer will provide training to the chatbot to learn from the information.
5. In this chatbot, a text file esports.txt is used to train the chatbot. The text file is stored in the same directory as the chatbot.ipynb. 
6. Finally, when the file is executed in jupyter, the text file helps to give results to the input query in real-time.
